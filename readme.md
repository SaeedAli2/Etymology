# Philosophy book website
- This website contains inspirational quotes alongside displaying a list of books that I have read and those I have yet to read. It is beneficial as I can use this in the future and make regular updates as my book library increases. Furthermore, as I become more knowledgable in regards to coding, I can implement many additional features which will be pleasing to me when I look through the collection. It is a website which will hopefully be regularly updated even after the submission for the assignment.
## Testing 
- Showed the website to family members and friends which enabled me to improve features and enhance website usability. This was done by acknowledging how best to layout the site alongside allowing the site to have a consistent colour scheme.
- Regularly validated website for html and css errors and fixed these as I went along to prevent many bugs appearing once the website had been completed.
