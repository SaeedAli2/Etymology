# Philosophy book website
- This website contains inspirational quotes alongside displaying a list of books that I have read and those I have yet to read. It is beneficial as I can use this in the future and make regular updates as my book library increases. Furthermore, as I become more knowledgable in regards to coding, I can implement many additional features which will be pleasing to me when I look through the collection. It is a website which will hopefully be regularly updated even after the submission for the assignment.
## Layout
- I made use of floats, grid and flexbox throughout the website. The floats were used for the book sections to lay them out side by side. And for the sections underneath so they displayed correctly in the required position.
- The grid layout was used for the book containers and enabled me to change the number of books displayed per column depending on the size of the page using grid template columns.
- Flexbox was used for the further reading section to display the evenly spaced circles. 
## Testing 
- Showed the website to family members and friends which enabled me to improve features and enhance website usability. This was done by acknowledging how best to layout the site alongside allowing the site to have a consistent colour scheme.
- Regularly validated website for html and css errors and fixed these as I went along to prevent many bugs appearing once the website had been completed.
- Had an issue with the submit button not working which was due to the quotes section having a position of fixed instead of absolute. This resolved the issue but then caused another issue of a horizontal scroll briefly appearing on the page due to hover effects on the original quotes. Both of these issues were then completely resolved by keeping the quotes as fixed and then making the submit button position as sticky.
